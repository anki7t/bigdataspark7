Big data is defined by four v
velocity
veracity
variety
volume

monolithic system is not scalable, distributed system is scalable.
monolithic-->adding more power to same machine like keeping box on top of another
distributed--->adding more resource machine in network like keeping box horizontal next to another box.
monolithic is called vertical scaling
distributed is called horizontal scaling.

two kind of things--1.Namenode 2.datanode
it has master slave architecture.
we can call it co-ordinator and executor nodes.

whenever a request comes it goes to namenode first , then namenode checks the metadata entry table for requested data.
name node maintains a table of metadata it has information about which data nodes contains which data.

default block size is 128mb.

just to understand take small example..if you have file of 300mb file. this will be divided in 128*3 three parts
first part will have 128mb,second part will have 128mb,third part will have 44mb.so it will have three data chunks that will be distributed across cluster of data nodes.
further based on replication factor this data will be kept with some copy common practice is keeping 3 copy said as data with 3 replication factor.
